          My name is Theodor Wattman, I am 17 years old and I am currently
          studdying at Åva gymnasium in Täby. Right now I am spending my second
          year at the schools technology branch where we learn a wonderful
          amount about math and various current forms of technology such as
          programming and web design. This website was created for a school
          assignment where we made a website about ourselves. Well who am I?

      As previously stated, my name is Theodor. Theodor Wattman to be precise. I
      currently live in täby just north of Stockholm, Sweden where I spend most
      of my days studying at Åva gymnasium. I live with my two parents, my two
      smaller brothers and ofcourse my cat. <br /><br />
      My free time is most often dedicated to random adventures such as learning
      about why sperm whales sleep upright. Thats right, some would concider me
      a bit of a nerd, personally I would just consider myself someone who
      enjoys filling my head with useless information that I will never use
      except when I'm trying to annoy my friends and family. Other than that I
      spend 6 of my 7 days a week on activities, so far those activites comprise
      of 3 gym days and 4 guitar days. Well, those 4 guitar days are in reality
      split into one guitar lesson, two band lessons and one three hour
      bandplaying session that I just do with two of my friends for fun. I have
      been playing guitar for 2 years and its by far one of my favourite things
      to do, I only just decided to start playing with other musicians (I dont
      know if I qualify but it sounds cool so why not). I joined my first band
      with some strangers on the 21st of september, I joined my second band on
      the 23rd, that probably gives an idea of how much I enjoy it considering I
      joine another band two days after the first. <br /><br />
      When it comes to the academics, I am currently studying at Åva at the
      technology branch. Most people would probably go crazy over the amount of
      math that we are forced to do here but not I. I love math. It hasnt always
      been like that though, I used to hate math, and I mean HATE. I used to
      have this teacher who just took away all the fun from the subject, it
      sucked because I thought I hated math but in reality I just sort of hated
      her. When she announced that she was leaving the school I actually let out
      an audibly "YES!!!" which to this day is probably the stupidest and rudest
      thing ive ever said. I had to give an "sincere" apology to her afterwards
      where I said that i didnt mean it, but I really did. The teacher that
      replaced her was amazing, his name was Mr Lafferty. He showed me how much
      fun it can be to play around with numbers, I sort of started to love math
      after that point. Math was the big reason as to why I chose the technology
      branch, it can be a little overwhelming at some points but in the picture
      its all great. We also have all the computer subjects which is great, im
      not the biggest fan of Computer and Network technology but I love
      programming. It might be because I have it easy when it comes to it, for
      some reason it just makes sense.
